Regular maintenance release containing a bug fixes and UI improvements based on feedback gathered from the new Portal survey (you can still take it [here](https://forms.gle/K3sMq9PCd6Ze32366)!).

### New Portal Navigation!
In preparation for upcoming projects and feature expansion the Portal has been given a new global navigation element in the form of a left-anchored drawer. The dashboard will continue to function as a homepage where we plan on adding more useful widgets in the future. You can view all of your organizations in a table view, sort by multiple columns, and **filter on the ones you own**. Any of your API Console tabs are now accessible from anywhere in the Portal. Additionally your profile is now nested underneath a Settings tab, as many more settings are to come!

### Bug fixes
- API Console pressing `Enter` to send after filling out some request details would sometimes not send all request details
- Extra long request URLs were eating up all the space in the request tab toolbar
- Proper validation of initial seller/buyer password during Organization Create
- Enahnced UI for API Clients now allows editing of `IsAnonBuyer` field

### Improvements
- Show organization owners their data access
- Allow filtering on organziations you own
- Add a "Copy Request URL" button to items in the Request History Menu
- Enhanced Roles Selector now available in the regular API Console view
