Released on Wednesday, February 19th, 2020 at 8 PM CST.

This release marks the exciting beginning of a new OrderCloud public site and portal. These changes optimize the existing developer workflow and set the stage for future tools that will help our clients get the most out of the OrderCloud platform. 

## The OrderCloud Portal
Previously located at `developer.ordercloud.io`, we have made the transition to the ReactJS frontend framework - preparing for an entirely new class of tools that will be made available at `portal.ordercloud.io` throughout 2020 and beyond. Don't be fooled by the new look and location - your account and data remain intact and you can login [here](https://portal.ordercloud.io/login).

Once authenticated, you will see a new Portal hompage with two distinct widgets for the API Console and Seller Organizations you own or have access to. We've spent a lot of time making the new API Console the best it can be. You'll notice right away that you now have context-driven tabs! This feature allows you to maintain multiple sessions across any of your organizations. Simply start a new tab, select your context, and start making API calls!

Some aspects of OrderCloud are still limited to your developer- excuse me, _portal_ user; such as managing Seller Organizations and Contributor access. By clicking on a Seller Organization from the hompage widget you will see the interface for managing these settings.

For more information on using the new OrderCloud Portal see [this guide](/getting-started/using-the-portal).

## Open Source Documentation
In an effort to increase visibility and community participation in improving how users learn about the platform, we've started our first [open source documentation repository](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/oc-documentation) - powered by [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). If you see something that could be better, simply make a pull request and someone from our team will review your changes! 

Our API reference pages are generated using the latest version of the [OrderCloud OpenApi 3.0 specification](https://api.ordercloud.io/v1/openapi/v3) - so improvements to these pages are limited to the internal Four51 development team. Feel free log issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/oc-documentation/issues) or ask questions in the [community channel](/slack).

In addition to this open source approach, we've greatly improved the searchability of our documentation and API reference.

## Release Notes
Parallel to these release notes we have an updated location for our [API Release Notes](/release-notes), the current API version is visible at the top `ordercloud.io` and will link you to the latest publically announced release note. The latest public release note version may not match the current API version, this is because we do not publically announce every version as some do not include anything perceptible by our users.
