This released fixed some non-critical issues related to [v1.0.35](/portal-release-notes/v1.0.35)

### Bug Fixes
- Some Enhanced UI resources in the API Console were not properly authenticated and the user would be logged out unexpectedly
- Organization ID is now optional when creating a new Seller Organization, as it was before [v1.0.35](/portal-release-notes/v1.0.35)
- Forgotten Password flow was broken due to incorrect redirects being applied on unauthenticated routes
- Authenticated Portal Users navigating from [the OrderCloud Public Site](https://ordercloud.io) were presented with a blank screen

### Improvements
- Organizations in the Portal can now be filtered by their Environment (All, Production, Staging, or Sandbox)
