Webhooks enable user-defined HTTP callbacks for all writable endpoints in the OrderCloud API. Each webhook can be assigned to multiple applications within this Seller Organization.

When a webhook event is triggered on an assigned application, OrderCloud will forward the request details to the Payload URL.
