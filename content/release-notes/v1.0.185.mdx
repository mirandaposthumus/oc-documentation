- Bug fix: calling `GET /orders/{direction}/{orderID}/worksheet` with an invalid orderID now returns a 404 instead of a 500
- Limiting access to these resources to seller users only:
  - Message senders
  - Api clients
  - Incrementors (any user can still use an incrementorID when creating an object)
  - Integration events
  - Webhooks
  - Xp indices
  - OpenIDConnect
  - ImpersonationConfigs
  - SecurityProfiles
