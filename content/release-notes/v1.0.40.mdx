## Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't update a Category's `ParentID` to null
- Fixed a bug around promotions with value expressions evaluating `product.incategory`
- Removed some `ApprovalRule` fields related to features that don't exist yet.
- Fixed a tricksy bug where in some situations, the `Meta` of a list would change if the `pageSize` changed.
- You now get a much more helpful error if you try to assign a price to a product that doesn't exist.
