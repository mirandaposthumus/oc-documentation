- Introduced Supplier-owned Price Schedules. Supplier can only edit Price Schedules that they create.
- Enforce unique IDs across entire marketplace for things a Supplier might own (Products, Catalogs, Price Schedules, and Specs).
- Allow `Payment.Amount` to be updated to 0. This better enables recording Payments that were reversed (such as with a credit or void transaction) and you wish to maintain that history rather than deleting the Payment. (`Payment.Amount` must still be greater than 0 on _create_.)
