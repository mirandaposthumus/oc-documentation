- Suppliers can create/edit/manage Specs under `v1/specs/*` endpoints. Sellers cannot see Supplier-created specs, except in relation to Products that they have been assigned to.
- New endpoint: GET `v1/products/{productID}/specs`. Previously available only under me/products, it is now possible to list specs associated with a product from an "admin" perspective.
- Spec model returned from any endpoint now contains an `Options` collection. (Also previously available only under me endpoints.)
