## Bugs

- Payments: Payment with Type `SpendingAccount` must have `SpendingAccountID`
- Unable to use `PUT` to create new `UserGroup`
- Orders: `order.Total` not updated when `ShippingCost` is updated via `PATCH`

## New Features

- Added transactional email support for guest checkout ([documentation](http://qa-documentation.ordercloud.io/api-reference#Orders_PatchFromUser))

```
`PATCH` `v1/orders/{direction}/{orderID}/fromuser`
{"FirstName": "", "LastName": "", "Email": ""}
```

- Products: Allow negation of all filters on admin Product List (`catalogID`, `categoryID`, `supplierID`)
