- New API resources for creating/managing Security Profiles (functionality previously only available via Dev Center UI).
- New API resources for creating/managing custom Roles.
- Bugfix: With Premium Search, creating a new Buyer with `DefaultCatalogID` set to an existing catalog did not trigger a search index rebuild. Therefore, Users under the new Buyer could not see products until some other triggering action occurred.
- Bugfix: For Suppliers, `DateCreated` was updated whenever the Supplier was updated. Should only get set once on create.
