## Summary

- Added Multi-Field `OR` filters to `me/products` endpoint for Search 2.0 enabled orgs.

## Updates

### Multi-Field `OR` Filters On `Me/Products` & Search 2.0 Orgs

Previously, with filters there was no way to specify multiple fields and get results back when _any_ match. This is now supported with syntax like:

`me/products?ID|Name|Description=*foo*`

This will return any product with `foo` in the ID, Name, or Description. This functionality is currently limited to the `me/products` endpoint in orgs with Search 2.0 enabled. We're hoping that this will facilitate ease of transfer to the new search platform.

> Note that field names are case sensitive!
